# This file excludes paths from the Docker build context.
#
# By default, Docker's build context includes all files (and folders) in the
# current directory. Even if a file isn't copied into the container it is still sent to
# the Docker daemon.
#
# There are multiple reasons to exclude files from the build context:
#
# 1. Prevent nested folders from being copied into the container (ex: exclude
#    /assets/node_modules when copying /assets)
# 2. Reduce the size of the build context and improve build time (ex. /build, /deps, /doc)
# 3. Avoid sending files containing sensitive information
#
