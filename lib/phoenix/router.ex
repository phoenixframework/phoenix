  Defines a Phoenix router.

  The router provides a set of macros for generating routes
  that dispatch to specific controllers and actions. Those
  macros are named after HTTP verbs. For example:

      defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do
        use Phoenix.Router

        get "/pages/:page", PageController, :show
      end

  The `get/3` macro above accepts a request to `/pages/hello` and dispatches
  it to `PageController`'s `show` action with `%{"page" => "hello"}` in
  `params`.

  Phoenix's router is extremely efficient, as it relies on Elixir
  pattern matching for matching routes and serving requests.

  ## Routing

  `get/3`, `post/3`, `put/3`, and other macros named after HTTP verbs are used
  to create routes.

  The route:

      get "/pages", PageController, :index

  matches a `GET` request to `/pages` and dispatches it to the `index` action in
  `PageController`.

      get "/pages/:page", PageController, :show

  matches `/pages/hello` and dispatches to the `show` action with
  `%{"page" => "hello"}` in `params`.

      defmodule PageController do
        def show(conn, params) do
          # %{"page" => "hello"} == params
        end
      end

  Partial and multiple segments can be matched. For example:

      get "/api/v:version/pages/:id", PageController, :show

  matches `/api/v1/pages/2` and puts `%{"version" => "1", "id" => "2"}` in
  `params`. Only the trailing part of a segment can be captured.

  Routes are matched from top to bottom. The second route here:

      get "/pages/:page", PageController, :show
      get "/pages/hello", PageController, :hello

  will never match `/pages/hello` because `/pages/:page` matches that first.

  Routes can use glob-like patterns to match trailing segments.

      get "/pages/*page", PageController, :show

  matches `/pages/hello/world` and puts the globbed segments in `params["page"]`.

      GET /pages/hello/world
      %{"page" => ["hello", "world"]} = params

  Globs cannot have prefixes nor suffixes, but can be mixed with variables:

      get "/pages/he:page/*rest", PageController, :show

  matches

      GET /pages/hello
      %{"page" => "llo", "rest" => []} = params

      GET /pages/hey/there/world
      %{"page" => "y", "rest" => ["there" "world"]} = params

  ## Generating routes

  For generating routes inside your application,  see the `Phoenix.VerifiedRoutes`
  documentation for `~p` based route generation which is the preferred way to
  generate route paths and URLs with compile-time verification.

  Phoenix also supports generating function helpers, which was the default
  mechanism in Phoenix v1.6 and earlier. we will explore it next.

  ### Helpers

  Phoenix generates a module `Helpers` inside your router by default, which contains
  named helpers to help developers generate and keep their routes up to date.
  Helpers can be disabled by passing `helpers: false` to `use Phoenix.Router`.

  Helpers are automatically generated based on the controller name.
  For example, the route:

      get "/pages/:page", PageController, :show

  will generate the following named helper:

      MyAppWeb.Router.Helpers.page_path(conn_or_endpoint, :show, "hello")
      "/pages/hello"

      MyAppWeb.Router.Helpers.page_path(conn_or_endpoint, :show, "hello", some: "query")
      "/pages/hello?some=query"

      MyAppWeb.Router.Helpers.page_url(conn_or_endpoint, :show, "hello")
      "http://example.com/pages/hello"

      MyAppWeb.Router.Helpers.page_url(conn_or_endpoint, :show, "hello", some: "query")
      "http://example.com/pages/hello?some=query"

  If the route contains glob-like patterns, parameters for those have to be given as
  list:

      MyAppWeb.Router.Helpers.page_path(conn_or_endpoint, :show, ["hello", "world"])
      "/pages/hello/world"

  The URL generated in the named URL helpers is based on the configuration for
  `:url`, `:http` and `:https`. However, if for some reason you need to manually
  control the URL generation, the url helpers also allow you to pass in a `URI`
  struct:

      uri = %URI{scheme: "https", host: "other.example.com"}
      MyAppWeb.Router.Helpers.page_url(uri, :show, "hello")
      "https://other.example.com/pages/hello"

  The named helper can also be customized with the `:as` option. Given
  the route:

      get "/pages/:page", PageController, :show, as: :special_page

  the named helper will be:

      MyAppWeb.Router.Helpers.special_page_path(conn, :show, "hello")
      "/pages/hello"

  ## Scopes and Resources

  It is very common in Phoenix applications to namespace all of your
  routes under the application scope:

      scope "/", MyAppWeb do
        get "/pages/:id", PageController, :show
      end

  The route above will dispatch to `MyAppWeb.PageController`. This syntax
  is not only convenient for developers, since we don't have to repeat
  the `MyAppWeb.` prefix on all routes, but it also allows Phoenix to put
  less pressure on the Elixir compiler. If instead we had written:

      get "/pages/:id", MyAppWeb.PageController, :show

  The Elixir compiler would infer that the router depends directly on
  `MyAppWeb.PageController`, which is not true. By using scopes, Phoenix
  can properly hint to the Elixir compiler the controller is not an
  actual dependency of the router. This provides more efficient
  compilation times.

  Scopes allow us to scope on any path or even on the helper name:

      scope "/v1", MyAppWeb, host: "api." do
        get "/pages/:id", PageController, :show
      end

  For example, the route above will match on the path `"/api/v1/pages/1"`
  and the named route will be `api_v1_page_path`, as expected from the
  values given to `scope/2` option.

  Like all paths you can define dynamic segments that will be applied as
  parameters in the controller:

      scope "/api/:version", MyAppWeb do
        get "/pages/:id", PageController, :show
      end

  For example, the route above will match on the path `"/api/v1/pages/1"`
  and in the controller the `params` argument will have a map with the
  key `:version` with the value `"v1"`.

  Phoenix also provides a `resources/4` macro that allows developers
  to generate "RESTful" routes to a given resource:

      defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do
        use Phoenix.Router

        resources "/pages", PageController, only: [:show]
        resources "/users", UserController, except: [:delete]
      end

  Finally, Phoenix ships with a `mix phx.routes` task that nicely
  formats all routes in a given router. We can use it to verify all
  routes included in the router above:

      $ mix phx.routes
      page_path  GET    /pages/:id       PageController.show/2
      user_path  GET    /users           UserController.index/2
      user_path  GET    /users/:id/edit  UserController.edit/2
      user_path  GET    /users/new       UserController.new/2
      user_path  GET    /users/:id       UserController.show/2
      user_path  POST   /users           UserController.create/2
      user_path  PATCH  /users/:id       UserController.update/2
                 PUT    /users/:id       UserController.update/2

  One can also pass a router explicitly as an argument to the task:

      $ mix phx.routes MyAppWeb.Router

  Check `scope/2` and `resources/4` for more information.

  ## Pipelines and plugs

  Once a request arrives at the Phoenix router, it performs
  a series of transformations through pipelines until the
  request is dispatched to a desired route.

  Such transformations are defined via plugs, as defined
  in the [Plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug) specification.
  Once a pipeline is defined, it can be piped through per scope.

  For example:

      defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do
        use Phoenix.Router

        pipeline :browser do
          plug :fetch_session
          plug :accepts, ["html"]
        end

        scope "/" do
          pipe_through :browser

          # browser related routes and resources
        end
      end

  `Phoenix.Router` imports functions from both `Plug.Conn` and `Phoenix.Controller`
  to help define plugs. In the example above, `fetch_session/2`
  comes from `Plug.Conn` while `accepts/2` comes from `Phoenix.Controller`.

  Note that router pipelines are only invoked after a route is found.
  No plug is invoked in case no matches were found.

  ## How to organize my routes?

  In Phoenix, we tend to define several pipelines, that provide specific
  functionality. For example, the `pipeline :browser` above includes plugs
  that are common for all routes that are meant to be accessed by a browser.
  Similarly, if you are also serving `:api` requests, you would have a separate
  `:api` pipeline that validates information specific to your endpoints.

  Perhaps more importantly, it is also very common to define pipelines specific
  to authentication and authorization. For example, you might have a pipeline
  that requires all users are authenticated. Another pipeline may enforce only
  admin users can access certain routes. Since routes are matched top to bottom,
  it is recommended to place the authenticated/authorized routes before the
  less restricted routes to ensure they are matched first.

  Once your pipelines are defined, you reuse the pipelines in the desired
  scopes, grouping your routes around their pipelines. For example, imagine
  you are building a blog. Anyone can read a post, but only authenticated
  users can create them. Your routes could look like this:

      pipeline :browser do
        plug :fetch_session
        plug :accepts, ["html"]
      end

      pipeline :auth do
        plug :ensure_authenticated
      end

      scope "/" do
        pipe_through [:browser, :auth]

        get "/posts/new", PostController, :new
        post "/posts", PostController, :create
      end

      scope "/" do
        pipe_through [:browser]

        get "/posts", PostController, :index
        get "/posts/:id", PostController, :show
      end

  Note in the above how the routes are split across different scopes.
  While the separation can be confusing at first, it has one big upside:
  it is very easy to inspect your routes and see all routes that, for
  example, require authentication and which ones do not. This helps with
  auditing and making sure your routes have the proper scope.

  You can create as few or as many scopes as you want. Because pipelines
  are reusable across scopes, they help encapsulate common functionality
  and you can compose them as necessary on each scope you define.

  Generates a route match based on an arbitrary HTTP method.

  Useful for defining routes not included in the builtin macros.

  The catch-all verb, `:*`, may also be used to match all HTTP methods.

  ## Options

    * `:as` - configures the named helper. If false, does not generate
      a helper. Has no effect when using verified routes exclusively
    * `:alias` - configure if the scope alias should be applied to the route.
      Defaults to true, disables scoping if false.
    * `:log` - the level to log the route dispatching under, may be set to false. Defaults to
      `:debug`. Route dispatching contains information about how the route is handled (which controller
      action is called, what parameters are available and which pipelines are used) and is separate from
      the plug level logging. To alter the plug log level, please see

  Defines "RESTful" routes for a resource.

  The given definition:

  will include routes to the following actions:

    * `GET /users` => `:index`
    * `GET /users/new` => `:new`
    * `POST /users` => `:create`
    * `GET /users/:id` => `:show`

    * `PATCH /users/:id` => `:update`
    * `PUT /users/:id` => `:update`
    * `DELETE /users/:id` => `:delete`

  ## Options

  This macro accepts a set of options:

    * `:only` - a list of actions to generate routes for, for example: `[:show, :edit]`
    * `:except` - a list of actions to exclude generated routes from, for example: `[:delete]`
    * `:param` - the name of the parameter for this resource, defaults to `"id"`
    * `:name` - the prefix for this resource. This is used for the named helper
      and as the prefix for the parameter in nested resources. The default value
      is automatically derived from the controller name, i.e. `UserController` will
      have name `"user"`
    * `:as` - configures the named helper. If false, does not generate
      a helper. Has no effect when using verified routes exclusively
    * `:singleton` - defines routes for a singleton resource that is looked up by
      the client without referencing an ID. Read below for more information

  ## Singleton resources

  When a resource needs to be looked up without referencing an ID, because
  it contains only a single entry in the given context, the `:singleton`
  option can be used to generate a set of routes that are specific to
  such single resource:

    * `GET /user` => `:show`
    * `GET /user/new` => `:new`
    * `POST /user` => `:create`
    * `GET /user/edit` => `:edit`
    * `PATCH /user` => `:update`
    * `PUT /user` => `:update`
    * `DELETE /user` => `:delete`

  Usage example:

      resources "/account", AccountController, only: [:show], singleton: true

  ## Nested Resources

  This macro also supports passing a nested block of route definitions.
  This is helpful for nesting children resources within their parents to
  generate nested routes.

  The given definition:

      resources "/users", UserController do
        resources "/posts", PostController
      end

  will include the following routes:

      user_post_path  GET     /users/:user_id/posts           PostController :index
      user_post_path  GET     /users/:user_id/posts/:id/edit  PostController :edit
      user_post_path  GET     /users/:user_id/posts/new       PostController :new
      user_post_path  GET     /users/:user_id/posts/:id       PostController :show
      user_post_path  POST    /users/:user_id/posts           PostController :create
      user_post_path  PATCH   /users/:user_id/posts/:id       PostController :update
