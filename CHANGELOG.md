# Changelog for v1.7

See the [upgrade guide](https://gist.github.com/chrismccord/00a6ea2a96bc57df0cce526bd20af8a7) to upgrade from Phoenix 1.6.x.

Phoenix v1.7 requires Elixir v1.11+ & Erlang v22.1+.

## Introduction of Verified Routes

Phoenix 1.7 includes a new `Phoenix.VerifiedRoutes` feature which provides `~p`
for route generation with compile-time verification.

Use of the `sigil_p` macro allows paths and URLs throughout your
application to be compile-time verified against your Phoenix router(s).
For example the following path and URL usages:

    <.link href={~p"/sessions/new"} method="post">Log in</.link>

    redirect(to: url(~p"/posts/#{post}"))

Will be verified against your standard `Phoenix.Router` definitions:

    get "/posts/:post_id", PostController, :show
    post "/sessions/new", SessionController, :create

Unmatched routes will issue compiler warnings:

    warning: no route path for AppWeb.Router matches "/postz/#{post}"
      lib/app_web/controllers/post_controller.ex:100: AppWeb.PostController.show/2

*Note: Elixir v1.14+ is required for comprehensive warnings. Older versions
will work properly and warn on new compilations, but changes to the router file
will not issue new warnings.*

This feature replaces the `Helpers` module generated in your Phoenix router, but helpers
will continue to work and be generated. You can disable router helpers by passing the
`helpers: false` option to `use Phoenix.Router`.

## phx.new revamp

The `phx.new` application generator has been improved to rely on function components for
both Controller and LiveView rendering, ultimately simplifying the rendering stack of
Phoenix applications and providing better reuse.

New applications come with a collection of well-documented and accessible core components,
styled with Tailwind CSS by default. You can opt-out of Tailwind CSS with the `--no-tailwind`
flag (the Tailwind CSS classes are kept in the generated components as reference for
future styling).

## 1.7.14 (2024-06-18)

### Bug fixes
  * Revert "Add `follow_redirect/2` to Phoenix.ConnTest" (#5797) as this conflicts with `follow_redirect/2` in LiveView, which is imported with ConnTest by default

## 1.7.13 (2024-06-18)

### Bug fixes
  * Fix Elixir 1.17 warning in Cowboy2Adapter
  * Fix verified routes emitting diagnostics without file and position

### JavaScript Client Bug Fixes
  * Fix error when `sessionStorage` is not available on global namespace

### Enhancements
  * Add `follow_redirect/2` to Phoenix.ConnTest
  * Use LiveView 1.0.0-rc for newly generated applications
  * Use new `Phoenix.Component.used_input?` for form errors in generated `core_components.ex`
  * Allow `mix ecto.setup` from the umbrella root
  * Bump Endpoint static cache manifest on `config_change` callback

## 1.7.12 (2024-04-11)

### JavaScript Client Bug Fixes
  * Fix all unjoined channels from being removed from the socket when channel leave is called on any single unjoined channel instance

### Enhancements
  * [phx.gen.auth] Add enhanced session fixation protection.
    For applications whichs previously used `phx.gen.auth`, the following line can be added to the `renew_session` function in the auth module:

    ```diff
      defp renew_session(conn) do
    +   delete_csrf_token()

        conn
        |> configure_session(renew: true)
        |> clear_session()
    ```

    *Note*: because the session id is in a http-only cookie by default, the only way to perform this attack prior to this change is if your application was already vulnerable to an XSS attack, which itself grants more escalated "privileges” than the CSRF fixation.
