# Changelog for v1.8

This release requires Erlang/OTP 25+.

## `put_secure_browser_headers`

`put_secure_browser_headers` has been updated to the latest security practices. In particular, it sets the `content-security-policy` header to `"base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self';"` if none is set, restricting embedding of your application and the use of `<base>` element to same origin respectively. If you expect your application to be embedded by third-parties, you want to consult the documentation.

The deprecated headers `x-download-options` and `x-frame-options` are no longer set.

## v1.7

The CHANGELOG for v1.7 releases can be found in the [v1.7 branch](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/v1.7/CHANGELOG.md).
