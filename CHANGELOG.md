# Changelog for v1.8

This release requires Erlang/OTP 25+.

## Streamlined generators

  * Extend tailwindcss support in new apps with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for light/dark/system mode support for entire app, including core components
  * Simplify layout handling for new apps. Now there is only a single `root.html.heex` which wraps the render pipeline. Other dynamic layouts, like `app.html.heex` are called as needed within templates as regular function components
  * Simplify core components and live generators to more closely match basic `phx.gen.html` crud. This serves as a better base for seasoned devs to start with, and lessons the amount of code newcomers need to get up to speed with on the basics
  * Introduce magic links (passwordless auth) and "sudo mode" to `mix phx.gen.auth` while simplifying the generated structure
  * Introduce scopes to Phoenix generators, designed to make secure data access the *default*, not something you remember (or forget) to do later

## `put_secure_browser_headers`

`put_secure_browser_headers` has been updated to the latest security practices. In particular, it sets the `content-security-policy` header to `"base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self';"` if none is set, restricting embedding of your application and the use of `<base>` element to same origin respectively. If you expect your application to be embedded by third-parties, you want to consult the documentation.

The headers `x-download-options` and `x-frame-options` are no longer set as they have been deprecated by standards.

## Deprecations

This release introduces deprecation warnings for several features that have been soft-deprecated in the past.

  * `use Phoenix.Controller` must now specify the `:formats` option, which may be set to an empty list if the formats are not known upfront
  * The `:namespace` and `:put_default_views` options on `use Phoenix.Controller` are deprecated and emit a warning on use
  * Specifying layouts without modules, such as `put_layout(conn, :print)` or `put_layout(conn, html: :print)` is deprecated
  * The `:trailing_slash` option in `Phoenix.Router` has been deprecated in favor of using `Phoenix.VerifiedRoutes`. The overall usage of helpers will be deprecated in the future
