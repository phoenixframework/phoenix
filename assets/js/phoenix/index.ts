/**
 * Phoenix Channels JavaScript client
 *
 * ## Socket Connection
 *
 * A single connection is established to the server and
 * channels are multiplexed over the connection.
 * Connect to the server using the `Socket` class:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * let socket = new Socket("/socket", {params: {userToken: "123"}})
 * socket.connect()
 * ```
 *
 * The `Socket` constructor takes the mount point of the socket,
 * the authentication params, as well as options that can be found in
 * the Socket docs, such as configuring the `LongPoll` transport, and
 * heartbeat.
 *
 * ## Channels
 *
 * Channels are isolated, concurrent processes on the server that
 * subscribe to topics and broker events between the client and server.
 * To join a channel, you must provide the topic, and channel params for
 * authorization. Here's an example chat room example where `"new_msg"`
 * events are listened for, messages are pushed to the server, and
 * the channel is joined with ok/error/timeout matches:
 *
 * ```
 * let channel = socket.channel("room:123", {token: roomToken})
 * channel.on("new_msg", msg => console.log("Got message", msg) )
 * $input.onEnter( e => {
 *   channel.push("new_msg", {body: e.target.val}, 10000)
 *     .receive("ok", (msg) => console.log("created message", msg) )
 *     .receive("error", (reasons) => console.log("create failed", reasons) )
 *     .receive("timeout", () => console.log("Networking issue...") )
 * })
 *
 * channel.join()
 *   .receive("ok", ({messages}) => console.log("catching up", messages) )
 *   .receive("error", ({reason}) => console.log("failed join", reason) )
 *   .receive("timeout", () => console.log("Networking issue. Still waiting..."))
 *```
 *
 * ## Joining
 *
 * Creating a channel with `socket.channel(topic, params)`, binds the params to
 * `channel.params`, which are sent up on `channel.join()`.
 * Subsequent rejoins will send up the modified params for
 * updating authorization params, or passing up last_message_id information.
 * Successful joins receive an "ok" status, while unsuccessful joins
 * receive "error".
 *
 * With the default serializers and WebSocket transport, JSON text frames are
 * used for pushing a JSON object literal. If an `ArrayBuffer` instance is provided,
 * binary encoding will be used and the message will be sent with the binary
 * opcode.
 *
 * *Note*: binary messages are only supported on the WebSocket transport.
 *
 * ## Duplicate Join Subscriptions
 *
 * While the client may join any number of topics on any number of channels,
 * the client may only hold a single subscription for each unique topic at any
 * given time. When attempting to create a duplicate subscription,
 * the server will close the existing channel, log a warning, and
 * spawn a new channel for the topic. The client will have their
 * `channel.onClose` callbacks fired for the existing channel, and the new
 * channel join will have its receive hooks processed as normal.
 *
 * ## Pushing Messages
 *
 * From the previous example, we can see that pushing messages to the server
 * can be done with `channel.push(eventName, payload)` and we can optionally
 * receive responses from the push. Additionally, we can use
 * `receive("timeout", callback)` to abort waiting for our other `receive` hooks
 *  and take action after some period of waiting. The default timeout is 10000ms.
 *
 *
 * ## Socket Hooks
 *
 * Lifecycle events of the multiplexed connection can be hooked into via
 * `socket.onError()` and `socket.onClose()` events, ie:
 *
 * ```
 * socket.onError( () => console.log("there was an error with the connection!") )
 * socket.onClose( () => console.log("the connection dropped") )
 * ```
 *
 *
 * ## Channel Hooks
 *
 * For each joined channel, you can bind to `onError` and `onClose` events
 * to monitor the channel lifecycle, ie:
 *
 * ```
 * channel.onError( () => console.log("there was an error!") )
 * channel.onClose( () => console.log("the channel has gone away gracefully") )
 * ```
 *
 * ### onError hooks
 *
 * `onError` hooks are invoked if the socket connection drops, or the channel
 * crashes on the server. In either case, a channel rejoin is attempted
 * automatically in an exponential backoff manner.
 *
 * ### onClose hooks
 *
 * `onClose` hooks are invoked only in two cases. 1) the channel explicitly
 * closed on the server, or 2). The client explicitly closed, by calling
 * `channel.leave()`
 *
 *
 * ## Presence
 *
 * The `Presence` object provides features for syncing presence information
 * from the server with the client and handling presences joining and leaving.
 *
 * ### Syncing state from the server
 *
 * To sync presence state from the server, first instantiate an object and
 * pass your channel in to track lifecycle events:
 *
 * ```
 * let channel = socket.channel("some:topic")
 * let presence = new Presence(channel)
 * ```
 *
 * Next, use the `presence.onSync` callback to react to state changes
 * from the server. For example, to render the list of users every time
 * the list changes, you could write:
 *
 * ```
 * presence.onSync(() => {
 *   myRenderUsersFunction(presence.list())
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Listing Presences
 *
 * `presence.list` is used to return a list of presence information
 * based on the local state of metadata. By default, all presence
 * metadata is returned, but a `listBy` function can be supplied to
 * allow the client to select which metadata to use for a given presence.
 * For example, you may have a user online from different devices with
 * a metadata status of "online", but they have set themselves to "away"
 * on another device. In this case, the app may choose to use the "away"
 * status for what appears on the UI. The example below defines a `listBy`
 * function which prioritizes the first metadata which was registered for
 * each user. This could be the first tab they opened, or the first device
 * they came online from:
 *
 * ```
 * let listBy = (id, {metas: [first, ...rest]}) => {
 *   first.count = rest.length + 1 // count of this user's presences
 *   first.id = id
 *   return first
 * }
 * let onlineUsers = presence.list(listBy)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Handling individual presence join and leave events
 *
 * The `presence.onJoin` and `presence.onLeave` callbacks can be used to
 * react to individual presences joining and leaving the app. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * let presence = new Presence(channel)
 *
 * // detect if user has joined for the 1st time or from another tab/device
 * presence.onJoin((id, current, newPres) => {
 *   if(!current){
 *     console.log("user has entered for the first time", newPres)
 *   } else {
 *     console.log("user additional presence", newPres)
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * // detect if user has left from all tabs/devices, or is still present
 * presence.onLeave((id, current, leftPres) => {
 *   if(current.metas.length === 0){
 *     console.log("user has left from all devices", leftPres)
 *   } else {
 *     console.log("user left from a device", leftPres)
 *   }
 * })
 * // receive presence data from server
 * presence.onSync(() => {
 *   displayUsers(presence.list())
 * })
 * ```
