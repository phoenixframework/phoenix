# Introduction to Testing

> **Requirement**: This guide expects that you have gone through the [introductory guides](installation.html) and got a Phoenix application [up and running](up_and_running.html).

Testing has become integral to the software development process, and the ability to easily write meaningful tests is an indispensable feature for any modern web framework. Phoenix takes this seriously, providing support files to make all the major components of the framework easy to test. It also generates test modules with real-world examples alongside any generated modules to help get us going.

Elixir ships with a built-in testing framework called [ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit). ExUnit strives to be clear and explicit, keeping magic to a minimum. Phoenix uses ExUnit for all of its testing, and we will use it here as well.

## Running tests

When Phoenix generates a web application for us, it also includes tests. To run them, simply type `mix test`:

```console
$ mix test
....

Finished in 0.09 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 652656
```

We already have five tests!

In fact, we already have a directory structure completely set up for testing, including a test helper and support files.

```console
test
├── hello_web
│   └── controllers
│       ├── error_html_test.exs
│       ├── error_json_test.exs
│       └── page_controller_test.exs
├── support
│   ├── conn_case.ex
│   └── data_case.ex
└── test_helper.exs
```

The test cases we get for free include those from `test/hello_web/controllers/`. They are testing our controllers and views. If you haven't read the guides for controllers and views, now is a good time.

## Understanding test modules

We are going to use the next sections to get acquainted with Phoenix testing structure. We will start with the three test files generated by Phoenix.

The first test file we'll look at is `test/hello_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs`.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWeb.PageControllerTest do
  use HelloWeb.ConnCase

  test "GET /", %{conn: conn} do
    conn = get(conn, ~p"/")
    assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Peace of mind from prototype to production"
  end
end
```

There are a couple of interesting things happening here.

Our test files simply define modules. At the top of each module, you will find a line such as:

```elixir
use HelloWeb.ConnCase
```

If you were to write an Elixir library, outside of Phoenix, instead of `use HelloWeb.ConnCase` you would write `use ExUnit.Case`. However, Phoenix already ships with a bunch of functionality for testing controllers and `HelloWeb.ConnCase` builds on top of `ExUnit.Case` to bring these functionalities in. We will explore the `HelloWeb.ConnCase` module soon.

Then we define each test using the `test/3` macro. The `test/3` macro receives three arguments: the test name, the testing context that we are pattern matching on, and the contents of the test. In this test, we access the root page of our application by a "GET" HTTP request on the path "/" with the `get/2` macro. Then we **assert** that the rendered page contains the string "Peace of mind from prototype to production".

When writing tests in Elixir, we use assertions to check that something is true. In our case, `assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Peace of mind from prototype to production"` is doing a couple things:

  * It asserts that `conn` has rendered a response
  * It asserts that the response has the 200 status code (which means OK in HTTP parlance)
  * It asserts that the type of the response is HTML
  * It asserts that the result of `html_response(conn, 200)`, which is an HTML response, has the string "Peace of mind from prototype to production" in it

However, from where does the `conn` we use on `get` and `html_response` come from? To answer this question, let's take a look at `HelloWeb.ConnCase`.

## The ConnCase

If you open up `test/support/conn_case.ex`, you will find this (with comments removed):

```elixir
defmodule HelloWeb.ConnCase do
  use ExUnit.CaseTemplate

  using do
    quote do
      # The default endpoint for testing
      @endpoint HelloWeb.Endpoint

      use HelloWeb, :verified_routes

      # Import conveniences for testing with connections
      import Plug.Conn
      import Phoenix.ConnTest
      import HelloWeb.ConnCase
    end
  end
  
  setup tags do
    Hello.DataCase.setup_sandbox(tags)
    {:ok, conn: Phoenix.ConnTest.build_conn()}
  end
end
```

There is a lot to unpack here.

The second line says this is a case template. This is a ExUnit feature that allows developers to replace the built-in `use ExUnit.Case` by their own case. This line is pretty much what allows us to write `use HelloWeb.ConnCase` at the top of our controller tests.

Now that we have made this module a case template, we can define callbacks that are invoked on certain occasions. The `using` callback defines code to be injected on every module that calls `use HelloWeb.ConnCase`. In this case, it starts by setting the `@endpoint` module attribute with the name of our endpoint.

Next, it wires up `:verified_routes` to allow us to use `~p` based paths in our test just like we do in the rest of our application to easily generate paths and URLs in our tests.

Finally, we import [`Plug.Conn`](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html), so all of the connection helpers available in controllers are also available in tests, and then imports [`Phoenix.ConnTest`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.ConnTest.html). You can consult these modules to learn all functionality available.

Then our case template defines a `setup` block. The `setup` block will be called before test. Most of the setup block is on setting up the SQL Sandbox, which we will talk about later. In the last line of the `setup` block, we will find this:

```elixir
{:ok, conn: Phoenix.ConnTest.build_conn()}
```

The last line of `setup` can return test metadata that will be available in each test. The metadata we are passing forward here is a newly built `Plug.Conn`. In our test, we extract the connection out of this metadata at the very beginning of our test:

```elixir
test "GET /", %{conn: conn} do
```

And that's where the connection comes from! At first, the testing structure does come with a bit of indirection, but this indirection pays off as our test suite grows, since it allows us to cut down the amount of boilerplate.

## View tests

The other test files in our application are responsible for testing our views.

The error view test case, `test/hello_web/controllers/error_html_test.exs`, illustrates a few interesting things of its own.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWeb.ErrorHTMLTest do
  use HelloWeb.ConnCase, async: true

  # Bring render_to_string/4 for testing custom views
  import Phoenix.Template

  test "renders 404.html" do
    assert render_to_string(HelloWeb.ErrorHTML, "404", "html", []) == "Not Found"
  end

  test "renders 500.html" do
    assert render_to_string(HelloWeb.ErrorHTML, "500", "html", []) == "Internal Server Error"
  end
end
```

`HelloWeb.ErrorHTMLTest` sets `async: true` which means that this test case will be run in parallel with other test cases. While individual tests within the case still run serially, this can greatly increase overall test speeds.

It also imports `Phoenix.Template` in order to use the `render_to_string/4` function. With that, all the assertions can be simple string equality tests.

## Running tests per directory/file

Now that we have an idea what our tests are doing, let's look at different ways to run them.

As we saw near the beginning of this guide, we can run our entire suite of tests with `mix test`.

```console
$ mix test
....

Finished in 0.2 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 540755
```

If we would like to run all the tests in a given directory, `test/hello_web/controllers` for instance, we can pass the path to that directory to `mix test`.

```console
$ mix test test/hello_web/controllers/
.

Finished in 0.2 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 652376
```

In order to run all the tests in a specific file, we can pass the path to that file into `mix test`.

```console
$ mix test test/hello_web/controllers/error_html_test.exs
...

Finished in 0.2 seconds
2 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 220535
```

And we can run a single test in a file by appending a colon and a line number to the filename.

Let's say we only wanted to run the test for the way `HelloWeb.ErrorHTML` renders `500.html`. The test begins on line 11 of the file, so this is how we would do it.

```console
$ mix test test/hello_web/controllers/error_html_test.exs:11
Including tags: [line: "11"]
Excluding tags: [:test]

.

Finished in 0.1 seconds
2 tests, 0 failures, 1 excluded

Randomized with seed 288117
```

We chose to run this specifying the first line of the test, but actually, any line of that test will do. These line numbers would all work - `:11`, `:12`, or `:13`.

## Running tests using tags

ExUnit allows us to tag our tests individually or for the whole module. We can then choose to run only the tests with a specific tag, or we can exclude tests with that tag and run everything else.

Let's experiment with how this works.

First, we'll add a `@moduletag` to `test/hello_web/controllers/error_html_test.exs`.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWeb.ErrorHTMLTest do
  use HelloWeb.ConnCase, async: true

  @moduletag :error_view_case
  ...
end
```

If we use only an atom for our module tag, ExUnit assumes that it has a value of `true`. We could also specify a different value if we wanted.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWeb.ErrorHTMLTest do
  use HelloWeb.ConnCase, async: true

  @moduletag error_view_case: "some_interesting_value"
  ...
end
```

For now, let's leave it as a simple atom `@moduletag :error_view_case`.

We can run only the tests from the error view case by passing `--only error_view_case` into `mix test`.

```console
$ mix test --only error_view_case
Including tags: [:error_view_case]
Excluding tags: [:test]

...

Finished in 0.1 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures, 3 excluded

Randomized with seed 125659
```

> Note: ExUnit tells us exactly which tags it is including and excluding for each test run. If we look back to the previous section on running tests, we'll see that line numbers specified for individual tests are actually treated as tags.

```console
$ mix test test/hello_web/controllers/error_html_test.exs:11
Including tags: [line: "11"]
Excluding tags: [:test]

.

Finished in 0.2 seconds
2 tests, 0 failures, 1 excluded

Randomized with seed 364723
```

Specifying a value of `true` for `error_view_case` yields the same results.

```console
$ mix test --only error_view_case:true
Including tags: [error_view_case: "true"]
Excluding tags: [:test]

...

Finished in 0.1 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures, 3 excluded

Randomized with seed 833356
```

Specifying `false` as the value for `error_view_case`, however, will not run any tests because no tags in our system match `error_view_case: false`.

```console
$ mix test --only error_view_case:false
Including tags: [error_view_case: "false"]
Excluding tags: [:test]



Finished in 0.1 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures, 5 excluded

Randomized with seed 622422
The --only option was given to "mix test" but no test executed
```

We can use the `--exclude` flag in a similar way. This will run all of the tests except those in the error view case.

```console
$ mix test --exclude error_view_case
Excluding tags: [:error_view_case]

.

Finished in 0.2 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures, 2 excluded

Randomized with seed 682868
```

Specifying values for a tag works the same way for `--exclude` as it does for `--only`.

We can tag individual tests as well as full test cases. Let's tag a few tests in the error view case to see how this works.

```elixir
defmodule HelloWeb.ErrorHTMLTest do
  use HelloWeb.ConnCase, async: true

  @moduletag :error_view_case

  # Bring render/4 and render_to_string/4 for testing custom views
  import Phoenix.Template

  @tag individual_test: "yup"
  test "renders 404.html" do
    assert render_to_string(HelloWeb.ErrorView, "404", "html", []) ==
           "Not Found"
  end

  @tag individual_test: "nope"
  test "renders 500.html" do
    assert render_to_string(HelloWeb.ErrorView, "500", "html", []) ==
           "Internal Server Error"
  end
end
```

If we would like to run only tests tagged as `individual_test`, regardless of their value, this will work.

```console
$ mix test --only individual_test
Including tags: [:individual_test]
Excluding tags: [:test]

..

Finished in 0.1 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures, 3 excluded

Randomized with seed 813729
```

We can also specify a value and run only tests with that.

```console
$ mix test --only individual_test:yup
Including tags: [individual_test: "yup"]
Excluding tags: [:test]

.

Finished in 0.1 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures, 4 excluded

Randomized with seed 770938
```

Similarly, we can run all tests except for those tagged with a given value.

```console
$ mix test --exclude individual_test:nope
Excluding tags: [individual_test: "nope"]

...

Finished in 0.2 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures, 1 excluded

Randomized with seed 539324
```

We can be more specific and exclude all the tests from the error view case except the one tagged with `individual_test` that has the value "yup".

```console
$ mix test --exclude error_view_case --include individual_test:yup
Including tags: [individual_test: "yup"]
Excluding tags: [:error_view_case]

..

Finished in 0.2 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures, 1 excluded

Randomized with seed 61472
```

Finally, we can configure ExUnit to exclude tags by default. The default ExUnit configuration is done in the `test/test_helper.exs` file:

```elixir
ExUnit.start(exclude: [error_view_case: true])

Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.mode(Hello.Repo, :manual)
```

Now when we run `mix test`, it only runs the specs from our `page_controller_test.exs` and `error_json_test.exs`.

```console
$ mix test
Excluding tags: [error_view_case: true]

.

Finished in 0.2 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures, 2 excluded

Randomized with seed 186055
```

We can override this behavior with the `--include` flag, telling `mix test` to include tests tagged with `error_view_case`.

```console
$ mix test --include error_view_case
Including tags: [:error_view_case]
Excluding tags: [error_view_case: true]

....

Finished in 0.2 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 748424
```

This technique can be very useful to control very long running tests, which you may only want to run in CI or in specific scenarios.

## Randomization

Running tests in random order is a good way to ensure that our tests are truly isolated. If we notice that we get sporadic failures for a given test, it may be because a previous test changes the state of the system in ways that aren't cleaned up afterward, thereby affecting the tests which follow. Those failures might only present themselves if the tests are run in a specific order.

ExUnit will randomize the order tests run in by default, using an integer to seed the randomization. If we notice that a specific random seed triggers our intermittent failure, we can re-run the tests with that same seed to reliably recreate that test sequence in order to help us figure out what the problem is.

```console
$ mix test --seed 401472
....

Finished in 0.2 seconds
5 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 401472
```

## Concurrency and partitioning

As we have seen, ExUnit allows developers to run tests concurrently. This allows developers to use all of the power in their machine to run their test suites as fast as possible. Couple this with Phoenix performance, most test suites compile and run in a fraction of the time compared to other frameworks.

While developers usually have powerful machines available to them during development, this may not always be the case in your Continuous Integration servers. For this reason, ExUnit also supports out of the box test partitioning in test environments. If you open up your `config/test.exs`, you will find the database name set to:

```elixir
database: "hello_test#{System.get_env("MIX_TEST_PARTITION")}",
```

By default, the `MIX_TEST_PARTITION` environment variable has no value, and therefore it has no effect. But in your CI server, you can, for example, split your test suite across machines by using four distinct commands:

```console
$ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=1 mix test --partitions 4
$ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=2 mix test --partitions 4
$ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=3 mix test --partitions 4
$ MIX_TEST_PARTITION=4 mix test --partitions 4
```

That's all you need to do and ExUnit and Phoenix will take care of all rest, including setting up the database for each distinct partition with a distinct name.

## Going further

While ExUnit is a simple test framework, it provides a really flexible and robust test runner through the `mix test` command. We recommend you to run `mix help test` or [read the docs online](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Test.html)

We've seen what Phoenix gives us with a newly generated app. Furthermore, whenever you generate a new resource, Phoenix will generate all appropriate tests for that resource too. For example, you can create a complete scaffold with schema, context, controllers, and views by running the following command at the root of your application:

```console
$ mix phx.gen.html Blog Post posts title body:text
* creating lib/hello_web/controllers/post_controller.ex
* creating lib/hello_web/controllers/post_html/edit.html.heex
* creating lib/hello_web/controllers/post_html/index.html.heex
* creating lib/hello_web/controllers/post_html/new.html.heex
* creating lib/hello_web/controllers/post_html/show.html.heex
* creating lib/hello_web/controllers/post_html/post_form.html.heex
* creating lib/hello_web/controllers/post_html.ex
* creating test/hello_web/controllers/post_controller_test.exs
* creating lib/hello/blog/post.ex
* creating priv/repo/migrations/20211001233016_create_posts.exs
* creating lib/hello/blog.ex
* injecting lib/hello/blog.ex
* creating test/hello/blog_test.exs
* injecting test/hello/blog_test.exs
* creating test/support/fixtures/blog_fixtures.ex
* injecting test/support/fixtures/blog_fixtures.ex

Add the resource to your browser scope in lib/demo_web/router.ex:

    resources "/posts", PostController


Remember to update your repository by running migrations:

    $ mix ecto.migrate

```

Now let's follow the directions and add the new resources route to our `lib/hello_web/router.ex` file and run the migrations.

When we run `mix test` again, we see that we now have twenty-one tests!

```console
$ mix test
................

Finished in 0.1 seconds
21 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 537537
```

At this point, we are at a great place to transition to the rest of the testing guides, in which we'll examine these tests in much more detail, and add some of our own.
