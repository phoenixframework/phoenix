# How to use Phoenix

this file would describe high level rules for using Phoenix.
It should have:
- prevention against common footguns that the agent makes
- Core guidelines that set agents on the correct path
- breadcrumbs, but not full context. Link to docs for more etc.

It should not have:
- Ecto usage guidelines
- other dependency usage rules, those live in those dependencies
